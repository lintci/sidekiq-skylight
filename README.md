## This gem is deprecated. Use the official one instead. See https://blog.skylight.io/background-jobs/

Middleware for instrumenting Sidekiq with Skylight.io

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-skylight'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq-skylight

## Blacklisted Jobs

If there's a job that you don't want to be instrumented via Skylight, you can
use the `blacklisted_workers` config option like so:

```ruby
Sidekiq::Skylight.configure do |config|
  config.blacklisted_workers = ['BlacklistedWorker']
end
```

Any workers with the class names you specify will be ignored from any Skylight tracing.

## ActiveJob

If you use Sidekiq as a backend to ActiveJob, your ActiveJob name will be passed to Skylight.

## Usage

Make sure you've setup skylight.io for your project already. Everything else should be automatic.
